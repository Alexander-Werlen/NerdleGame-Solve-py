# NerdleGame-Solve-py

Program that determines which is the best opening equation and the follow-ups for the game called "NerdleGame"

Works. But it takes 14 days to compute

Rewritten everything in c++. Now it only would take around 7 days to compute everything :) although tbh there might be some redundancy in the way I tried to model the game.
