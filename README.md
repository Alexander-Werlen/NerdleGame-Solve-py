# NerdleGame-Solve-py
Program that determines which is the best opening equation and the follow-ups for the game called "NerdleGame"

Works, but I still have to make it user friendly.

Currently it actually only works for the "mini" version (6 slots instead of 8), and not for the classical one. This is because when calculating all the possible combinations of inputs for the classical (8 slots) version, I would have to make around 2.5 BILLION combinations instead of the 14 million needed for the 6 slot version. I think it is possible to get around the problems that this arises, but it will take a little bit of time.
